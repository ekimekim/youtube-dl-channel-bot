This program is designed to run periodically (eg. on crontab), and check for new videos
on a list of youtube channels. Note it doesn't do this in a very efficient way right now,
favoring simplicity and existing tooling over speed. It doesn't really matter
since it runs in the background anyway.

It maintains a config/state file in ~/.youtube-dl-channel-bot.conf with the following syntax:
	[ LAST_CHECKED <tab> ] CHANNEL_URL <tab> PATH
LAST_CHECKED is intended to be added by the bot, and is a timestamp in epoch time.
CHANNEL_URL is the channel to be checked for videos.
PATH is where to put the downloaded files, and must be absolute.

In addition, you can specify an action to take after files have been downloaded.
After each invocation, the file ~/.youtube-dl-channel-bot.hook (if it exists and is executable)
is called, and the new files specified as absolute paths on stdin, newline-seperated.
